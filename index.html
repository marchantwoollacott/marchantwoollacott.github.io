			<h1>MAIGA: Input hell by LANDF</h1>
				<p>Hey you, are games too easy. Have you ever wanted to dodge a bullet hell with one hand and shuffle a deck of cards in the other? Well then MAGIA; Input Hell! is the perfect game for you.</p>
				
				<p>In MAGIA; Input Hell! you will play as Caliber, a novice Mage who relies on book casting. With only a few pages in his magic book he is forced to utilize his spells to maximum efficiency. In his quest across the land. you will find more magic spells and pages for more combinations and more powerful spells.</p>
				<p>You would collect more knowledge and power and you would start going deeper into the dubious Magiaâ€™s Evil world underground.</p>
